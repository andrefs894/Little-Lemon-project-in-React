This is my final project in React for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate in Coursera.

This project consists in a website for the fictional Little Lemon restaurant and has a Home page, About page and Reservations page with a form to reserve a table.

In the API folder there's a file server.js that you can run to set up the server that will handle the GET and POST requests for the table reservations.

To use the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Go to API folder and run `node server.js` to start the API server.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
